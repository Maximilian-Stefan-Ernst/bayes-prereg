In response to the replication crisis, many researchers have begun to preregister their analyses before acquiring data to produce more robust research results.
However, many researchers find preregistration challenging because they struggle to translate their theories into precise predictions and believe that only strictly confirmatory studies benefit from preregistration.
Such a focus on confirmatory studies severely limits the potential benefit of preregistration for the broader research community. 
At the same time, this focus implies that researchers prioritize preregistering results instead of procedures.
Preregistering procedures would allow researchers to deal more effectively with the uncertainties inherent in empirical research.
However, while such a paradigm shift would extend the utility of preregistration, it dissolves the distinction between confirmatory and exploratory that so far has justified it.
Drawing from Bayesian philosophy of science, we provide a principled justification that allows researchers to evaluate their own and others' preregistrations and weigh the cost and benefits of deviating from the analysis plan after data collection.
This objective rests on the concept of *theoretical risk* [@meehlTheoreticalRisksTabular1978], a generalization of the type-I error rate that allows researchers to judge the evidential support for their theories.
We argue that the purpose of preregistration is to reduce the uncertainty in judging the theoretical risk of a given study.
The more we know about how researchers arrived at their findings, the smaller the uncertainty about the theoretical risk they accepted and the more persuasive the researchers' evidence.
