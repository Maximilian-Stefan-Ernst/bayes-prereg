The replication crisis spurned many researchers to preregister their analyses before acquiring data.
However, there is no agreement on what preregistration should accomplish and why it is uniquely suited to these goals.
A widespread view is that preregistration should limit how much the data may influence the hypotheses tested on the same data (i.e., restrict researchers' degrees of freedom, alpha error, and theoretical risk).
Consequently, many researchers believe that only confirmatory studies benefit from preregistration.
Hence, they struggle to preregister their research, as many study designs and theories require adapting to the data.
We show that limiting preregistration to confirmatory research is unnecessarily restrictive.
To that end, we formalize the objective of preregistration and demonstrate that exploratory studies benefit from the practice.
Drawing on Bayesian philosophy of science, we argue that preregistration should aim to reduce uncertainty about the inferential procedure used to derive the results.
Crucially, this objective separates preregistration from the goal of confirmatory research and provides a principled justification in its own right.
While the extent to which a study is exploratory is essential, certainty about the inferential procedure is indispensable for persuasive evidence.
Lastly, we discuss what implications these insights have for the practice of preregistration.
