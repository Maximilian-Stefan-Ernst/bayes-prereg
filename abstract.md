Preregistration is becoming increasingly popular in the psychological sciences <!-- AB->AP: what for...?-->.
At the same time, many researchers struggle to translate their theories into precise predictions <!--not everyone may see their data-analytic approach as a predictive one, though; --> and may feel overwhelmed by the need to prespecify every minitous detail of their analysis plan.
Should they surrender and discard the idea of preregistration altogether?
Not at all.
We argue for the benefits of preregistration for studies that have both confirmatory and exploratory elements.
From a Bayesian perspective, we define a formal objective for preregistration that neither declares posthoc changes to a preregistration to be sinful nor punishes rigour.
This objective rests on the idea of “theoretical risk”, which is a generalization of type-I error rate, for judging the evidential support for theories. A common view is that preregistration is supposed to limit the false positive rate by committing to a specific data analysis plan before data are collected. <!-- AB->AP: I think it's important to more specifically state the common view before you introduce an alternative view-->
In our view, the purpose of preregistration is to reduce the uncertainty in judging the theoretical risk of a given study. 
We argue that this perspective <!--I would go with 'perspective' throughout--> extends the utility of preregistration, provides a principled justification for preregistration and is more closely aligned with researchers' intuition <!-- AB->AP: about what, about what preregistration does?!-->.
The less we know how researchers arrived at their findings, the larger our uncertainty about the theoretical risk they accepted, and the more severe the utility of the researchers' evidence is limited. <!--AB->AP: no change in meaning, just phrasing-->
Preregistration can be used to effectively reduce this uncertainty and therefore preregistered studies can generate more persuasive evidence.
