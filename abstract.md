In response to the replication crisis, many researchers preregister their analyses before acquiring data to produce more robust research results.
However, there is disagreement on what the practice should accomplish.
In fact, many researchers believe that only confirmatory studies benefit from preregistration.
As a result they find themselves struggling to make precise predictions from vague theories.
This restriction to confirmatory studies is unnecessary and precludes most studies from harnessing the benefits of preregistration.
To employ preregistration as a useful tool, researchers must understand to what end to employ it.
A common view is to limit the extend to which data informs the hypothesis (i.e., researchers degrees of freedom, alpha error, theoretical risk).
We argue that instead the goal is to reduce uncertainty about the underlying inferential procedure.
To that end, we derive a formal objective for preregistration that draws on Bayesian philosophy of science.
We show that the persuasiveness of the researchers' evidence is bounded by the uncertainty about the method used to derive it.
Under the objective to reduce this uncertainty, we can provide a principled justification for preregistration because it is uniquely positioned to archive the objective.
