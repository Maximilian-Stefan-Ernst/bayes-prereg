In response to the replication crisis, many researchers detail their analysis plans before acquiring data.
So-called preregistrations hold the promise to produce more robust research results.
However, many researchers find preregistration challenging to apply in practice because they struggle to translate their theories into precise predictions.
We argue that much of this difficulty stems from the belief that researchers must preregister results when, in fact, they can preregister procedures.
While the former is only possible for the small subset of strictly confirmatory studies, the latter is applicable even amid the considerable uncertainties present in empirical sciences.
Drawing from Bayesian philosophy of science, we provide a principled justification of preregistration that extends its utility beyond confirmatory studies and is more closely aligned with researchers' needs and intuition about evidential support.
Such justification provides researchers with a formal objective that allows them to evaluate their own and others' preregistrations and weigh the cost and benefits of deviating from the analysis plan after data collection.
This objective rests on the concept of "theoretical risk" [@meehlTheoreticalRisksTabular1978], a generalization of the type-I error rate that allows researchers to judge the evidential support for their theories.
We argue that the purpose of preregistration is to reduce the uncertainty in judging the theoretical risk of a given study.
The more we know about how researchers arrived at their findings, the smaller the uncertainty about the theoretical risk they accepted and the more persuasive the researchers' evidence.
