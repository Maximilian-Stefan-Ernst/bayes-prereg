The replication crisis spurned many researchers to preregister their analyses before acquiring data.
A widespread view is that preregistration should limit how much the data may influence the hypotheses tested on the same data.
This is commonly referred to as restricting researchers' degrees of freedom, alpha error, or theoretical risk.
If no such influence occurs, an analysis is generally considered confirmatory. 
Consequently, many researchers believe that only confirmatory studies benefit from preregistration.
Hence, they struggle to preregister their research due to ill-defined theories that require some adaptations to the data.
We argue that limiting preregistration to confirmatory research is unnecessarily restrictive.
To that end, we formalize a general objective of preregistration and demonstrate that exploratory studies also benefit from preregistration.
Drawing on Bayesian philosophy of science, we argue that preregistration should aim to reduce uncertainty about the inferential procedure used to derive the results.
Crucially, this objective separates preregistration from the goal of confirmatory research and provides a principled justification in its own right.
While the extent to which a study is exploratory is important, certainty about the inferential procedure is a precondition for persuasive evidence.
Lastly, we discuss what implications these insights have for the practice of preregistration.
