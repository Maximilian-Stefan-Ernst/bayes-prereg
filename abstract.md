In response to the replication crisis, many researchers preregister their analyses before acquiring data to produce more robust results.
However, there is no agreement on what preregistration should accomplish and why it is suited to archive these goals.
A widespread view is to limit the extent to which data informs the hypothesis it is tested on (i.e., researchers' degrees of freedom, alpha error, theoretical risk).
Consequently, many researchers believe that only confirmatory studies benefit from preregistration.
Hence, they struggle to preregister their research, as many study designs and theories require adapting to the data.
However, the restriction to strictly confirmatory studies is unnecessary and precludes many studies from harnessing the benefits of preregistration.
To employ preregistration as a useful tool, researchers must understand to what end to employ it.
We argue that preregistration should aim to reduce uncertainty about the inferential procedure used to derive the results.
Drawing on Bayesian philosophy of science, we formalize this objective and provide a principled justification for preregistration.
In this framework, we model the persuasiveness of the researchers' evidence as a function of the extent to which a study is exploratory and the uncertainty about the inferential procedure.
We, therefore, divorce the objective of confirmatory science from the objective of preregistration.
We show that highly confirmatory studies remain unpersuasive without preregistration and that even highly exploratory studies have much to gain from preregistration.
At last, we discuss what implications these insights have for the practice of preregistration.
