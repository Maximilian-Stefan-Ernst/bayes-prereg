# Why does preregistration increase the persuasiveness of evidence? A Bayesian rationalization.

As a response to the replication crisis, preregistration is becoming
increasingly popular in the psychological sciences to explicitly
separate prediction from explinations after the fact. At the same time,
many researchers struggle to translate their theories into precise
predictions and may feel overwhelmed by the need to prespecify every
detail of their analysis plan. Should they surrender and discard the
idea of preregistration altogether? Not at all. We argue for the utility
of preregistration for all types of studies, even beyond purely
confirmatory studies. Drawing from Bayesian philosophy of science, we
define a formal objective for preregistration that neither declares post
hoc changes to a preregistration to be sinful nor punishes rigor. This
objective rests on the concept of ‚Äútheoretical risk‚Äù (Meehl 1978), which
is a generalization of the type-I error rate that allows researchers to
judge the evidential support for their theories. A common view is that
preregistration is supposed to limit the type-I error rate by committing
to a specific data analysis plan before data are collected. In our view,
the purpose of preregistration is to reduce the uncertainty in judging
the theoretical risk of a given study. We argue that this perspective
provides a principled justification for preregistration, extends its
utility, and is more closely aligned with researchers‚Äô intuitions about
evidential support. The more we know about how researchers arrived at
their findings, the smaller our uncertainty about the theoretical risk
they accepted, and the more persuasive the researchers‚Äô evidence is.
Preregistrations can effectively reduce uncertainty about theoretical
risk, which increases the persuasiveness of evidence, and hence they are
warranted for any empirical study.
